Requirement Clarifictions

"at least one image must be an original creation" -
    We have included our original creation in the index.html file. The image is our movie poster for Abominable. It exists as this element; 
    <img class="poster-main" src="images/abominable.jpg"> 

"at least one link to another page of your site, on every page of your site" - 
    In our index.html file, clicking on the Joker movie image will redirect the user to our other site, popular-movie.html.
    In our popular-movie.html file, clicking on the "Movie Flix" h1 tag at the top of the page will redirect the user to index.html.

"one of your styles should be "position: absolute", and it should (along with other styles) position at least one element to overlap another one" -
    In our popular-movie.html file, we have used this property for our "Synopsis" h3 header located inside our div with the class name "movie-desc". The header is being overlapped
    with the parent div.
